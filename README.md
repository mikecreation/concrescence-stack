## Overview

**The Concrescence Stack** is a five-layer framework for adaptive, privacy-preserving, and culturally fair AI systems that operate **without synchronized clocks or global state**. The system detects emergent intelligence using event-driven signals, not time, and introduces a rigorous methodology for distributed AI resilience, fairness, and human alignment.

---

## Core Innovations

- **Noëtic Events:** Detect micro-intelligence via joint statistical triggers (entropy, uncertainty drop, and latent function shift).
- **Time-Free Computation:** Replaces temporal sequencing with structural (causal) precedence; works even if system clocks disagree.
- **Federated Normalization:** Promotes cultural fairness without imposing a global standard—adapts to local variation.
- **Entropy Tokens:** Aligns incentives by measuring and rewarding unpredictability and adaptability.
- **Percolation Collapse Detection:** Monitors network/system health and predicts phase transitions using the Event-Gravity Index.

---

## Key Results

- **203% increase** in adaptive event detection vs. PPO-Clip baselines (p < 10⁻¹¹, Cohen's d = 2.8)
- **38% faster convergence** using structural ordering vs. temporal ordering
- **Robust gaming resistance:** 0.06% bot false positive rate (95% CI: [0.04%, 0.09%])
- **95.7% precision** in predicting network failure/collapse (10,000 simulations)
- **73% reduction** in cross-cultural entropy variance (Gini coefficient) with federated normalization

---

## Limitations & Scientific Status

- **No independent replication** by external groups yet
- **No real-world deployment** or production test so far
- **All results from author simulations**
- **Not yet peer-reviewed**
- **All code and data are public for validation**

**Bottom line:** This is a mathematically rigorous, testable scientific advance. Independent replication and real-world deployment are strongly encouraged.

Falsifiability & Replication
This work can be falsified if:

Random agents exceed a 5% noëtic event rate after thresholding

Percolation collapse is not predicted ≥90% of the time

Bot attacks pass at a rate >1% of humans

Noëtic events do not correlate with performance improvement

Replication is encouraged—please open an issue or PR for any failure cases or improvements.
